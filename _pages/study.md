# Study Information

<span style="color:red">**THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTEREST, PARTICIPATION IN THIS STUDY IS NOW CLOSED. PLEASE CONTACT u6674497@anu.edu.au FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR FEEDBACK.**</span>

Hi!

My name is Lillian and I am conducting research at the Australian National University for my Psychology Honours thesis. My study seeks to explore mental health consumer perspectives towards practitioners with personal (or “lived”) experience of mental illness. I would love to hear your thoughts and invite you to participate in this qualitative exploration. 

With the support of my supervisor, Brett Scholz, participants will be required to complete either a survey (online) or interview (online or in-person in Canberra). The two methods of participation are offered to ensure that participants feel as comfortable as possible. Questions will explore your attitudes regarding mental health practitioners who have lived experience/s of mental illness, such as ‘how would you feel if a mental health practitioner referred to their own experience of mental illness in working with you?’. Questions will not ask about your personal experiences of mental illness, but you may choose to include this information in your responses where relevant. 

Responses will then be collated, deidentified and analysed (thematically) for themes or patterns which may improve our understanding of consumer attitudes and even inform future relevant policy and academia.

Both my supervisor and I feel passionately about amplifying mental health consumer voices and more meaningfully engaging with their perspectives and would be so grateful for your support in this effort.

Please find more information below if you would like to participate.
